# Page Navigation Component

## Show a series of form pages (e.g. “Info”, “Details”, “Other”, “Ending”)
## Support drag to re-order pages
## Support adding a new page between any two existing pages via a "+" button that appears on hover
## Open a context menu per page (rename, duplicate, delete - those buttons don't need to do anything though)
## Highlight the active page + allow selecting other pages
